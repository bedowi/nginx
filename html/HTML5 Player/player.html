   <!--
   The below function call creates Unreal HTML5 player:
   RunPlayer(strVideoPlayerID, intVideoWidth, intVideoHeight, strServerIP, intServerPort, boolSecureWebsocket, strOrArrayLiveAlias, strSecureToken, boolAutoPlay, boolShowControls, intLocalSeekMinutes, strPosterURL, boolBigButtons);
   
   strVideoPlayerID:          ID of player element on the webpage. If you have multiple players on the webpage, be sure to assign them different IDs.
   intVideoWidth:             Width of player in pixels.
   intVideoHeight:            Height of player in pixels.
   strServerIP:               IP Address of Unreal Media Server.
   intServerPort:             Port of Unreal Media Server, either for regular or for secure connections.
   boolSecureWebsocket:       If true then you must have a valid SSL certificate configured on the server computer.
   strOrArrayLiveAlias:       Alias of the live broadcast. Or an array of alias names for adaptive streaming. The array should have highest bitrate alias coming first and lowest bitrate alias coming last.
   strSecureToken:            Secure token such as Session ID for Session-based authentication. Empty string means no secure token is used.
   boolAutoPlay:              Whether to start playing as soon as webpage loads. Ignored and set to false when playing on mobile devices.
   boolShowControls:          Whether to display controls. If boolAutoPlay is false then this parameter is ignored and set to true.
   intLocalSeekMinutes:       Amount of minutes to keep in local buffer. This parameter is ignored if there is an active server-side timeshift. User will be able to seek in live stream within this time period. Recommended setting is 1-10 minutes. Browsers may evict data earlier than this setting, based on stream bitrate.
   strPosterURL:              URL of the poster image. Empty string means no poster image is used.
   boolBigButtons:            Whether to display regular or large buttons.
